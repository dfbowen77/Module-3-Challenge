# Module-3-Challenge
This is the repo for my Module 3 Challenge submission

## Description
The following webpage is designed to meet the requirements of the Module 3 Challenge. It represents the beginnings of a password generator. Users are prompted concerning password length and whether they would like the generated password to include lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and/or symbols. A password is then created based on their specific criteria. The screen shots in the following section show the webpage both prior to, and after, password generation.
